# 🎓 Student Database Management System (SQL Project)

This is a beginner-friendly SQL project that simulates a simple **Student Database Management System** using **Oracle SQL Developer**.

It includes the creation of tables, inserting sample data, and running useful SQL queries to manage student records and course enrollments.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `create_tables.sql` – SQL script to create tables: Students, Courses, Enrollments
- `insert_data.sql` – SQL script to insert sample records into each table
- `queries.sql` – Useful SQL queries (SELECT, JOIN, ORDER BY, etc.)
- `README.md` – Project overview and instructions

---

## 🧱 Technologies Used

- **SQL**
- **Oracle SQL Developer** on Windows 11
- Tablespace: `USERS`
- Schema: `studentdb_user` (example)

## 📚 Features

✅ Create and manage 3 core tables:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Students  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Courses  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Enrollments

✅ Insert sample student and course data  
✅ Link students to courses using a junction table  
✅ Run common queries like:
- Get all students enrolled in a course
- List all courses with instructors
- Sort students by name or DOB
- Join tables using foreign keys
